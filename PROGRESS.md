# Progress tracking for DeviceEmulator MQTT integration

## 2025-07-19
- Inspected current mqtt_client.cpp (stub implementation)
- Located Paho MQTT C and C++ libraries in external/paho (headers and .lib files present)
- Confirmed absence of Paho linking in CMakeLists.txt
- Next: Update CMakeLists.txt to link with Paho MQTT libraries and implement real publishing in mqtt_client.cpp
